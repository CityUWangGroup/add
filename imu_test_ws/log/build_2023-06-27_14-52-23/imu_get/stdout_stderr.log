CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/cityu/code/add/imu_test_ws/build/imu_get/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/duanye/code/imu_test_ws/build/imu_get where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/home/cityu/code/add/imu_test_ws/imu_get/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/home/duanye/code/imu_test_ws/imu_get/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
